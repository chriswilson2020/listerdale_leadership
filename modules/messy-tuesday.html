      <h3>How to Use This Page</h3>
      <p>Find the scenario closest to what you're dealing with. Each path gives you a <strong>diagnosis first</strong> (what's likely going on), then a <strong>sequenced reading order</strong> through 2-3 modules. The order matters, don't skip to step 3 before doing step 1. And read the reality check at the end of each path. Not every situation has a clean fix.</p>

        <h4>Reality check</h4>
        <p>The most common leadership failure here isn't firing too quickly, it's waiting too long. If you've done the work and the answer is clear, delaying is not kindness. It's avoidance. The rest of your team already knows.</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
        <p><strong>Diagnosis before prescription.</strong> The biggest leadership mistake isn't using the wrong tool, it's reaching for a tool before understanding the problem. Slow down, ask the uncomfortable questions, and let the situation tell you what it needs. And remember: not every problem has a clean solution. Some situations require trade-offs, not fixes.</p>
